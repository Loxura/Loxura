I'm Ayub, an aspiring programmer with a passion for learning and growth. I'm excited to discover all the amazing things I can create with code. When I'm not learning to code, you can find me enjoying video games, reading, or seeking out the perfect cup of coffee. I'm always looking for opportunities to connect with other learners and collaborate on fun projects. Let's learn and grow together!
